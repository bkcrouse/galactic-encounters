Scene: As Rael ventures deeper, the room's lights flicker, casting eerie shadows. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the darknessâ€”a vibrant blue alien with multiple eyes and tentacles. This is Zylo, a stowaway from a distant planet. Instead of fear, there's a sense of wonder in both their eyes. Rael's visor, unable to classify Zylo, simply flashes "Unknown Lifeform Detected."
